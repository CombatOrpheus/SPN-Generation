**Learning:** In Julia, relying on vectorized broadcasts like `all(A .>= B, dims=1)` inside hot loops (such as state-space exploration like `get_enabled_transitions`) allocates intermediate boolean vectors and views which drastically degrades performance.
**Action:** Replace these operations with explicit `@inbounds` nested loops and early return/break mechanisms to avoid memory allocations and achieve ~10-15x speedups in those functions.
